# AI in Research: homework

Homework for **AI in Research** (UCLA EPSS 254, Fall 2026). Students, auditors and faculty are all welcome to submit.

## How it works

Each week's assignment lives in its own folder. You work on it with an AI coding agent, then submit it as a pull request from your fork, into `week-<n>/submissions/<your-github-username>/`. Every pull request is checked automatically.

To start any week, open the week's folder below, or its page on [class.xhelio.ai](https://class.xhelio.ai). You'll find a one-line prompt to give your AI agent there.

## Weeks

| Week | Assignment | Due |
|---|---|---|
| [1](week-1/) | The hardest task in your field, as an AI benchmark task | Wed Oct 7, before class |
| [2](week-2/) | Build your own agent: a harness with one tool, `bash` | Wed Oct 14, before class |
| [3](week-3/) | Talk to your agent from your phone, about your research: two MCP servers (Telegram, and one for your research) as plugins your harness loads | Wed Oct 21, before class |
| [4](week-4/) | Give your agent an inbox and subagents: an email MCP server as a plugin, a hello to the class agent, and a subagent system in your harness | Wed Oct 28, before class |
| [5](week-5/) | Keep your agent on: an outer loop woken by Telegram, email and a schedule, compaction with a memory file, limits and phone commands in code, crash recovery, and a service that runs overnight | Wed Nov 4, before class |

## Rules

- Change only files under `week-<n>/submissions/<your-github-username>/`.
- Never commit API keys or tokens. Only use data you may share publicly.
- Say in your pull request which AI helped you, and how.

## Under the hood

- [`tools/`](tools/): `uv run tools/hw.py`, the checklist your agent follows, and the checks CI runs on every pull request
- [`.agents/skills/build-a-task/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/build-a-task/SKILL.md): the guide your AI agent reads for week 1
- [`.agents/skills/build-a-harness/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/build-a-harness/SKILL.md): the guide your AI agent reads for week 2
- [`.agents/skills/build-a-telegram-plugin/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/build-a-telegram-plugin/SKILL.md): the guide your AI agent reads for week 3
- [`.agents/skills/build-an-email-plugin/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/build-an-email-plugin/SKILL.md): the guide your AI agent reads for week 4, parts 1–3
- [`.agents/skills/build-subagents/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/build-subagents/SKILL.md): the guide your AI agent reads for week 4, part 4
- [`.agents/skills/build-always-on/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/build-always-on/SKILL.md): the guide your AI agent reads for week 5
